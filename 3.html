Time lost cannot be regained. There are a lot of sayings about the fleeting nature of time. Right now, time is flying. In a volatile market where enterprises might need billions in revenue just to stand still there is a pressing need to understand how to compete and build back better as we go into 2021. Take the mortgage market. Lenders lost billions of pounds when lockdown stopped the housing market.</p> <p> A report conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit found this year that while AI adoption is widely in use by most financial institutions, 86% of banks and insurance companies plan to increase AI-related investment into technology by 2025. The research was drawn from retail and investment banks and insurance companies across Europe, APAC, and the US.</p> <p> One of the main reasons for this adoption comes down to time. Analytics and AI can support smarter financial industry planning, and shave time off every activity in order to beat competition and extract maximum value from the market where possible. It’s an important consideration as many financial services firms find themselves in an uncertain position post-Brexit and during the global pandemic. The future is uncertain, markets are volatile, and businesses, consumers, and the government have all been adjusting to changing circumstances. AI is held by financial sector firms as the technology with the potential to help them maintain competitiveness in this uncertainty.</p> <p> The Economist study found that while there is a strong degree of confidence in the benefits of AI, the reality is that the technology is not yet largely in use: More than half of respondents say AI is not incorporated into their processes and offerings, with only 15% saying the technology is used extensively across the organisation. However, the benefits that have already emerged combined with respondents’ plans to double down on AI investment in the short-term show this technology is slated to drive a massive wave of future growth for financial services.</p> <p> Avtar Dhillon</p> <p> Banks and insurance companies perceive AI as critical to unlocking new growth opportunities and reducing costs. Respondents were clear AI will transform businesses in a number of ways over the next five years, including spurring new products and services (27%), opening new markets (25%), and paving the way for innovation (25%). About one-third (29%) expect between 51% and 75% of their workloads to be supported by AI technologies in five years.</p> <p> In addition to driving growth, AI promises significant savings today and in the future: 37% reported that their organisation has reduced operational costs as a result of AI adoption, and 34% predict that AI will lower their cost base over the next five years. When it comes to other benefits, one-third of respondents each reported a greater use of predictive analytics (34%), increased employee capacity to handle workload volume (33%), and enhanced customer service and satisfaction (32%).</p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> Investment and retail banks emerge as AI leaders</strong> </p> <p> Investment banks are deploying a higher volume of new AI applications on average when compared to retail bank and insurance peers. They are also the most advanced in the implementation of training programmes: 54% have already implemented initiatives, compared with 46% in insurance and 48% in retail banks. Additionally, investment banks are most likely to use machine learning (63%) and image analysis (52%), whereas retail banks are more heavily deploying predictive analytics (71%) and virtual assistants (61%).</p> <p> The report also found that banks and insurers in APAC are trendsetters when it comes to adoption, training and measurement. 61% reported that half or more of their workload is supported by AI, compared with North America and Europe (both 41%). Europe’s low usage is partly a reporting problem: Almost 10% either had no metrics to measure AI-application success, or had not been measured for long enough to report on. By way of contrast, all APAC respondents had functional reporting metrics. Notably, APAC prioritises reskilling and training initiatives, with 75% expecting an increased investment in people over the next five years to learn more AI skills and arm them with resources compared to 59% in North America and 37% in Europe.</p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> The path forward: Upskilling frontline knowledge workers</strong> </p> <p> Despite relatively slow adoption rates to date, the promise of AI holds clear with 86% of respondents saying they plan to increase AI-related investments into the technology over the next five years. However, greater AI adoption will ultimately be driven by how much financial services organisations invest into upskilling their workforce. This upskilling is required to get real value from democratising insights.</p> <p> According to the data, the industry is at a halfway point when it comes to upskilling their employees, with 49% of respondents saying training initiatives for employees to better understand AI are currently in place. Another 42% have plans to implement such training.</p> <p> With cost reduction plans working (for over a third) or forecast (another third) using AI, as the data shows, the way ahead revolves around driving new growth. AI is seen to be the new growth engine, and the key to unlocking its potential requires investing in talent. Financial services companies must lower the technology barrier for ordinary employees to capitalise on the productivity and innovation gains made possible by AI. This is the end goal for most of the financial services industry, and many others to be able to react at the speed of thought to changing conditions, markets, and information bringing us back to the point: Making the best use of time, because getting to understanding has not been a fast process in the history of business intelligence.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> Related Topics:</span> <span> </span> <span> Up Next</span> <p> HOW BUSINESSES CAN USE THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE TO AUTOMATE.</p> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> Don t Miss</span> <p> FIVE THINGS EVERY PROCUREMENT PROFESSIONAL SHOULD KNOW BEFORE CHOOSING AN EPROCUREMENT SOLUTION</p> <h4> <span> You may like</span> </h4> <h3> <span> Business</span> </h3> <h1> IDENTIFYING FRAUD IN A WORLD OF COVID-19 COPYCATS</h1> <p> <strong> By Ian Newns, Fraud Specialist at RSA Security </strong> </p> <p> </p> <p> The pandemic has changed much about the way we live and work today. Unfortunately, as is often the case, those with malicious intent have been the quickest to react. They saw the huge surge in online consumer spending at the start of the year and immediately set about ways to capitalise, by hiding themselves among the increase in legitimate transactions. Banks continue to bear the brunt of these increasingly skilled campaigns: last year, over £1.2 billion was lost to fraud in the UK.</p> <p> Payment card scams accounted for the largest proportion (48 per cent) of these losses. If financial institutions want to get better at detecting and repelling these attempts, the answer lies in taking a data-driven and context-aware approach, so your analysts can identify new patterns as they emerge.</p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> From holidays to the yoga craze</strong> </p> <p> Customer data is the key to unlocking value for the typical fraudster, and they have plenty of ways to get hold of it. According to latest RSA Quarterly Fraud Report , phishing remained the most prolific type of fraud threat in the second quarter of this year, followed by brand abuse attacks, where fraudsters imitate a legitimate brand in online content such as social media, with the aim of misleading users. Despite being one of the most prolific and well-recognised online fraud tactics of the past decade, phishing emails are getting better at mimicking legitimate links, messages, accounts, individuals and websites, and successfully tricking users into giving up account logins, financial, or personal data.</p> <p> Ian Newns</p> <p> The result is that there’s now a glut of financial and identity data at the disposal of fraud groups today. And they’re using it in increasingly sophisticated ways to commit payment fraud.</p> <p> For example, when COVID-19 hit, the payments landscape changed almost overnight. Down went bookings with travel companies, cinemas and theatres, and up went spending with supermarkets, sports shops, and home furnishing and DIY stores; in fact, one of our home furnishing merchants recorded a 133 per cent increase in spending via online channels from Q1 to Q2 2020. While the panic buying of March thankfully seems to have abated, consumers’ changing preferences and appetite for products such as yoga mats, bread flour and house plants is likely to continue, especially as regional lockdowns take place across the UK.</p> <p> Well, fraudsters noticed these patterns too, and adapted their behaviour to mimic that of legitimate cardholders. While Q2 saw a 67 per cent quarter-on-quarter drop in mentions of hotels and airlines within the social media fraud groups that our fraud analysts track, scammers instead migrated to popular high-value purchases such as treadmills and exercise bikes.</p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> Blending into the background</strong> </p> <p> Other tricks designed to outwit traditional fraud prevention measures include the deployment of tools to alter browser session characteristics. An emulator could make a Windows machine appear to be an iOS session, for example. Or manipulations could be made to subvert timestamping, which would otherwise reveal that a transaction is being made from a different time zone, and therefore potentially a fraudster.</p> <p> Other techniques we’ve spotted in recent months include routing traffic through countries where customers of particular brands are more likely to live, and the monitoring of users via remote hacking tools to learn patterns of behaviour that can be repeated later. The emergence of the latter tactic is an interesting one, as it moves fraud away from its historic use of automation, which helps fraudsters run mass credential stuffing and other mechanised campaigns. If a scammer believes a specific high-value individual is worth the extra investment of their time, they’re now prepared to spend more time and effort mimicking their online behaviour with the hope of a big pay-off.</p> <p> Many of these techniques are shared on underground cybercrime forums, and even surface websites and social media groups. A recent surge in first-party fraud, where scammers make a genuine purchase but then fraudulently claim a refund, could also be helped by this kind of information circulating online. Forums discuss the different processes that individual merchants follow and some even explain to fraudsters how they can claim a refund without needing to make a purchase. Unfortunately, if the loss is relatively small, card issuers would often rather write-off the transaction than challenge the customer requesting a refund.</p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> Focus on the data</strong> </p> <p> Fortunately, there are things that banking fraud teams can do to reduce losses without deterring legitimate customers. Context is key: any fraud-prevention strategy you put in place must look closely at changing consumer behaviour and spending patterns to spot the fakes more easily. It should also look at individual spending: a consumer may make a one-off, high value purchase for a new PC, for example, but they’re not likely to do so more than once in a short space of time.</p> <p> This approach should be employed across all purchasing channels: mobile app, website, call centres etc. Calculate transaction volumes for each and check to see where fraud is highest. For example, as mobile purchases surged this year, so did fraud volumes—rising 26 per cent year-on-year in Q2. An omnichannel approach will give you a clearer, contextual view of fraud that will hopefully improve your detection rates.</p> <p> Finally, continue to enhance supervised machine learning tools with new data as it comes in. As long as it’s accurate and timely, it really is a case of “the more, the better” in this situation. Data-driven approaches like this enable fraud teams to adjust policies, create new ones and make better-informed decisions to enhance detection, even as fraud patterns evolve.</p> <p> The bottom line is that fraud, like cybercrime, is an arms race. The scammers are constantly innovating with new tools and techniques, shared with each other across dark web forums—so we must respond in kind. That means taking an adaptable, data-driven and context-aware approach that remains effective even as fraud changes.</p> <p> With Open Banking rules offering consumers more choice than ever in whom they bank with, friction-free security and high rates of fraud detection will increasingly become a market differentiator.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <span> Continue Reading</span> <h3> <span> Business</span> </h3> <h1> ALLIANZ BENELUX IS USING GRAPH TECHNOLOGY TO BEAT FRAUD AND BOOST CUSTOMER-CENTRICITY</h1> <p> <strong> Amy Hodler, Director, Analytics and AI Program Manager at Neo4j. </strong> </p> <p> </p> <p> Data expert Amy Hodler examines how graph technology is reducing insurance fraud and providing customer insight at one of the world’s largest financial services companies </p> <p> Financial services firms constantly have to fight financial criminals, but it is getting more demanding for organisations to identify and stop fraudulent activity at the scale it now occurs.</p> <p> Traditional methods for monitoring fraud, such as setting up rules to examine deviations from normal purchasing patterns, use discrete data. This is useful for catching individual criminals acting alone, but this approach falls short when it comes to detecting fraud rings. Sophisticated criminals continuously alter their strategies to circumvent detection. They utilise synthetic accounts to carry out what appear to be unrelated activities by unconnected individuals. However, these activities are in fact well-coordinated and criminally linked.</p> <p> The financial services sector needs a better way to follow the trail from one account to another to determine how activities that on the surface appear unrelated are in fact connected. This requires having a 360-degree view of the intricate fraud network to determine how suspicious events are linked.</p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> Fraud detection with graphs </strong> </p> <p> Graph database technology may be an invaluable tool in fighting fraud. In contrast to traditional relational databases, graphs not only interpret individual items of data, but also their relationships with one another. An increasing number of the world’s leading financial institutions are using graph databases to model and monitor data about customers, accounts, devices, locations and other attributes to identify fraudulent activity. Allianz, a multinational financial services company offering insurance products and services to 100 million customers in more than 70 countries, is one such.</p> <p> As a truly customer-centric insurer, Allianz Benelux takes a zero-tolerance stance on fraud. As the subsidiary’s chief data and analytics officer, Sudaman Thoppan Mohanchandralal, explains, “We need to secure customers from risk – not just today, but into the future. We can only do that by having full insight into the risk environment and with an ability to predict it for our customers.”</p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> Relational data model problems </strong> </p> <p> Mohanchandralal’s colleague, Dr. Jan Doumen, strategic lead for Customer &amp; Broker Information and Insights, agrees. “The best way to understand your customers and the risks they are exposed to on a daily basis is by storing, analysing and visualising them through connected data.</p> <p> “Graph technology does this at scale, which means we no longer have to rely only on highly demanding, traditional relational technologies.”</p> <p> Historically, building internal visualisations of suspicious behaviours with relational technology had been too demanding, Doumen confirms. The latest fraud countermeasures, such as network tracking, were too complex to build in a relational database. Sudaman calls this process a ‘2 by 2’ approach, where SQL database-style tables with rows and columns don’t offer the data connections fraud detection and prevention requires.</p> <p> Working with a relational data model doesn’t allow the Allianz Benelux team to extract useful data on the fly. In contrast, graph technologies spot potentially fraudulent activity in Allianz Benelux’s ecosystem by disclosing concealed illicit connections. Bringing all the customer data into a graph database permits the Allianz Benelux anti-fraud team to reveal the risk exposures in a motor or household context.</p> <p> “It is the combination of multi-node, multi-connection snapshots of customers and the much more efficient search possibilities coming from graph technology that we believed would revolutionise the way our internal business handles customers’ risks,” Doumen confirms.</p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> Clear business benefit </strong> </p> <p> Equally important for the Allianz Benelux team is having a 360-degree view of the customer. The Belelux operation has gone through a series of mergers and acquisitions and its customer data has become dispersed in separate silos, which has led to a number of operational inefficiencies.</p> <p> “When we were able to get to a level with graphs to show colleagues this holistic view of a customer, it was so much easier for them to understand rather than through a table with rows and columns. This will enable them to personalise their services towards our customers,” Doumen adds.</p> <p> Allianz Benelux’s success using the native graph approach has resulted in clear business benefits. Over the course of two years, €2 million of operational profit value was identified. Given the advantages realised with graphs, the Allianz Benelux team plans on offering the solution to other parts of the organisation.</p> <p> Graph databases can future-proof an organisation’s fraud prevention initiatives by providing insight based on data relationships and connected intelligence. They can also unlock data silos and generate a more unified view of customers – helping you achieve full ‘customer-centricity’, as well as drive more revenue. Sounds well worth investigating.</p> <p>   </p> <p> </p> <span> Continue Reading</span> <h4> <span> Magazine</span> </h4> <p> </p> <h4> <span> Trending</span> </h4> <span> News</span> <span> 4 hours ago</span> <h2> KASKO POWERS THE LAUNCH OF NEODIGITAL’S MOBILE PHONE INSURANCE</h2> <p> London-based InsurTech KASKO partners with German Neodigital on a mobile phone insurance product The two InsurTechs linked KASKO’s mobile first,...</p> <span> Banking</span> <span> 21 hours ago</span> <h2> REALISING THE POTENTIAL OF AI MARKETING TOOLS IN FINANCIAL SERVICES AND BANKING</h2> <p> Ben Michaelis, Managing Director, ThinkEngine Financial Services and Banking sector firms have been widely regarded as the innovators across...</p> <span> Finance</span> <span> 21 hours ago</span> <h2> 2021 TRENDS AND PREDICTIONS IN THE FINANCE INDUSTRY</h2> <p> Tim Blok, CTO, Onguard The finance industry has been hugely impacted by Covid-19, not least due to the move...</p> <span> Finance</span> <span> 22 hours ago</span> <h2> FINANCE TRANSFORMATION: FIVE TIPS TO ENSURE A SUCCESSFUL (AND ONGOING) DIGITAL CHANGE</h2> <p> By Mark White, Financial Performance Management Specialist, MHR Analytics Now is the time for organisations to invest in and...</p> <span> Business</span> <span> 22 hours ago</span> <h2> IDENTIFYING FRAUD IN A WORLD OF COVID-19 COPYCATS</h2> <p> By Ian Newns, Fraud Specialist at RSA Security The pandemic has changed much about the way we live and...</p> <span> Wealth Management</span> <span> 4 days ago</span> <h2> WHY TRADING FIRMS MAY STILL NEED A LONG-TERM REMOTE WORKING STRATEGY AMID COVID-19 VACCINE NEWS</h2> <p> By Terry Ewin, Vice President EMEA, IPC ‘Never let a good crisis go to waste’ is a phrase that...</p> <span> News</span> <span> 4 days ago</span> <h2> AURIGA TO MANAGE BELGIUM’S NEW NATIONWIDE ATM NETWORK: BATOPIN.</h2> <p> Batopin signs ATM as a Service agreement with Auriga to run the new network for Belgium’s four biggest banks ...</p> <span> Business</span> <span> 4 days ago</span> <h2> ALLIANZ BENELUX IS USING GRAPH TECHNOLOGY TO BEAT FRAUD AND BOOST CUSTOMER-CENTRICITY</h2> <p> Amy Hodler, Director, Analytics and AI Program Manager at Neo4j.
