But seeing how rough some of these data points were, still puts me back in my seat and probably will for you too.</p> <p> A few reasons I think America struggles so much financially includes:</p> Stagnant wages with increasing expenses (a stat below) Taking on too much debt (credit card, loans, housing) Not enough financial literacy to keep people out of bad financial situations People trying to keep up appearances (Keeping up with the Joneses) A heavy consumer mentality over an investor mentality <p> Of course, there are <strong> A LOT</strong> more stats that we could probably add to the list too. But I wanted to be selective and share some that can put things into perspective.</p> <p> And unless a lot of the above I mentioned changes in America, as well as more people taking financial action, these below stats may get worse.</p> <h2> <span> </span> <strong> Personal Finance Stats About Saving Money</strong> <span> </span> </h2> <p> Saving money whether for emergencies, investing, or retirement is something every person should strive to improve at.</p> <p> The challenge is everything is getting more expensive, wages can be stagnant, raising a family is not cheap, interest on loans are high, etc.</p> <p> Let’s look at some concerning personal finance statistics about saving money.</p> <span> 20% of Americans don’t save any of their annual income at all and even those who do save aren’t putting away a lot. ( CNBC )</span> Over 40% of Americans have less than $10,000 saved for when they retire. ( GoBankingRates ) 56% of millennials don&#8217;t have any money saved in a retirement account. The numbers were only a little less bleak for older generations: 39% of both Baby Boomers and Gen-Xers have nothing put away for their golden years. ( PurePoint Financial ) Two-thirds of Americans would struggle to scrounge up $1,000 in an emergency, according to The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research . Only 24% of millennials demonstrate basic financial literacy, according to a study from the National Endowment for Financial Education . The average American saves less than 5% of his or her disposable income. ( LA Times ) A report in MarketWatch found that half of American households currently live paycheck to paycheck. Of the Americans who have savings accounts, the median savings account balance is $5,200. The average, or mean balance is $33,766.49. ( SmartAsset ) Millennial earnings are low compared to median wages — lower than Gen-Xers or Baby Boomers when they were early in their careers. ( Center for Retirement Research ) CPA financial planners conducted a survey to see what their clients were worried about the most, and a staggering 41% reported that running out of cash was their biggest concern. The survey found that even those with comfortable incomes and net worths still faced significant fears that their coffers would run dry into their twilight years. A Gallup poll found only about 1/3 of Americans (32%) maintain a household budget The average American household has $180,040 in savings and retirement accounts. ( Magnify Money ) <h2> <span> </span> <strong> Finance Stats Related to Debt </strong> <span> </span> </h2> <p> Similarly, another issue taking over America and other parts of the world is debt. Between student loans, relying on or overusing credit cards, and high mortgages, there are some holy sh$t stats about debt out there.</p> <p> Here are a few:</p> The Federal Reserve reports on consumer debt each month. Here are historical statistics by month since 1943 . About 77 million Americans, or 35% of adults with a credit file, have debt in collections reported in their credit files, according to the Urban Institute . Nearly one-third of Americans pay the minimum due on their credit card each month, according to FINRA&#8217;s National Financial Capability Study . Credit card debt comes with a cost. The average household with revolving credit card debt pays $904 in interest annually. ( Nerd Wallet ) But the average American owes over $171,000 on their home, and the average monthly mortgage payment is more than $1,000. ( The Motley Fool ) According to the latest 2018 data from the Federal Reserve : Americans hold over $1 trillion in credit card debt ($1,023,000,000,000). Non-revolving debt (loans) total over $2.8 trillion ($2,842,400,000,000). Americans paid banks $104 billion in credit card interest and fees in 2018, up 11% from the prior year, and up 35% over the last five years, as Fed rate increases have been passed on to consumers. ( Magnify Money ) A high 44% of American adults — nearly half of us — are relying on an auto loan to pay for our car. ( Finder ) 43% of Americans spend more than they receive each month borrow and use credit cards to finance the shortfall. ( Federal Reserve ) The average credit card debt among Americans increased by 18.5% since 2013. ( Federal Reserve Bank of New York ) Total household debt is $13.67 trillion as of Q1 2019 according to a the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . <p> <strong> Extra</strong> : I’m adding in this interesting chart below, that shows consumer debt among the different generations.</p> Generation Z: $2,047 average credit card debt Generation Y: $4,315 average credit card debt Generation X: $7,750 average credit card debt Baby Boomers: $7,550 average credit card debt Silent Generation: $4,613 average credit card debt <h2> <span> </span> <strong> Finance Statistics Final Thoughts</strong> <span> </span> </h2> <p> Hopefully, the above personal finance statistics served not only as educational, but eye-opening to the current state of our finances.</p> <p> I think financial literacy is a big missing part to why Americans finances are looking rough. </p> <p> Despite the fact that America is the world’s largest economy,<strong> </strong> Americans actually rank 14th in financial literacy according to Standard &amp; Poor’s Global Financial Literacy Survey . </p> <p> Certainly not the worst position to be in, but troubling nonetheless. </p> <p> And we all have unique stories and situations that put us at different financial levels. The real challenge is what are you doing to break the cycle and not become another concerning finance stat?</p> <p> America has a lot of work to do to slow down these negative statistics, but a great first step is for us to take more initiative in our finances, money, and budgeting.</p> <p> <strong> What do you think about these personal finance stats about saving money and debt? Is it going to get worse? Are people starting to make changes? Have these numbers affected you to make changes?</strong> </p> <p> </p> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> <span> Filed Under: Financial Independence </span> </p> <h4> About <span> Todd Kunsman</span> </h4> <p> Founder of Invested Wallet and featured in Time, Business Insider, &amp; HuffPost.

[The Complete Answer]</span> <span> 17 Investing Tips That All Beginners Should Master On Day One &#xBB;</span> <h3> Comments</h3> <p> <span> Christopher Robbins </span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> December 4, 2018 at 1:17 pm </p> <p> I&#8217;m not sure I agree with the stagnant income argument median salaries and wages have largely overshot inflation over the past 30 years or so in most parts of the country. What&#8217;s changed is that we&#8217;re encouraged to buy a lot more with our dollar than we had previously we&#8217;ve done away with legacy health systems and introduced new drugs and interventions that make our potential healthcare costs a lot more expensive (though it&#8217;s debatable whether the additional expenses are necessary). We&#8217;ve also decided that college is a necessity for every human being, which has ridiculously inflated the average household expense on education (though it&#8217;s also debatable whether so many of us really need 4-year degrees). </p> <p> Outside of healthcare and education, inflation has been modest. We could say that salary increases have been modest as well, but in most areas they&#8217;ve outpaced inflation by at least 10 percent over the last few decades. Forgive me for not having the data on hand, but there was a FIRE blogger that had a good post about how salary stagnation is more myth than fact. Much if not most of the problem is cultural (see healthcare and education) or behavioral, not structural.</p> Reply <p> <span> Todd</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> December 4, 2018 at 2:03 pm </p> <p> Hey Christopher, thanks for that info and great points here. Generally, I think you are right. I also see living expenses on the rise too (even in non-major cities), while raises and the majority of salaries do not increase much. But I def agree with that we are encouraged to buy more with our dollar than previous.</p> Reply <p> <span> kyra</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> December 5, 2018 at 10:32 am </p> <p> It&#8217;s great that you&#8217;ve provided this information to readers!<br/> Not everyone has the same mindset, so it&#8217;s nice to actually read these numbers and take it into consideration how serious America&#8217;s financial statuses are.<br/> Hopefully if enough people take this information (and all other blogs posted by you) and try to change their ways of spending, that people can turn their spending habits around 🙂</p> Reply <p> <span> Marc @Vital Dollar </span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> December 11, 2018 at 4:09 pm </p> <p> These stats are definitely eye-opening. I think the one that stands out the most to me is that 2/3 of Americans would struggle to come up with $1,000 in an emergency.</p> Reply <p> <span> Todd</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> December 11, 2018 at 4:48 pm </p> <p> That one stood out to me too, pretty scary to think about. Hopefully, that number and all those stats start to improve.</p> Reply <h3> Leave a Reply Cancel reply </h3> <h4> Stay up to date</h4> <p> You ​may opt-out at any time. ​See our privacy policy. </p> <br> <h4> Popular Posts</h4> <h2> The First Year of Blogging: Twelve Months of Reflection </h2> <h2> How to Save $100k: The Journey to This Financial Milestone </h2> <h2> Instead of Pursuing FIRE, I&#8217;m Choosing EWYD (Enjoy What You Do) </h2> <h2> Don&#8217;t Feel Guilty About Spending Money [The ROI In Your Life] </h2> <h2> 15 Best Personal Finance Books to Boost Your Financial Knowledge </h2> <h2> 8 Simple Ways You Can Become Financially Literate On Your Own </h2> <h4> Subscribe Via Email</h4> <p> You ​may opt-out at any time. ​See our privacy policy. </p> <h4> Navigate</h4> Home Discover Investments Recommended Contact Disclaimer Privacy Policy Terms &#038; Conditions <p> <i> Invested Wallet LLC may have financial relationships with the companies mentioned or seen on this site.
